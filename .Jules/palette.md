## 2025-03-18 - [Typewriter Effect for Cinematics]
**Learning:** For dialogue-heavy cinematics in Unity, using TextMeshPro's `maxVisibleCharacters` is the most performant and layout-safe way to implement a typewriter effect. It prevents layout shifts and handles rich text tags (like colors or bolding) correctly by revealing the already-calculated characters rather than building the string character by character.
**Action:** Use `maxVisibleCharacters` in a coroutine and always manage coroutine references (`StopCoroutine`) to prevent overlapping text animations when dialogues change quickly.
