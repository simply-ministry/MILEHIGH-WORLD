## 2025-05-15 - [Optimizing Typewriter Effects for Cinematic Pacing]
**Learning:** When implementing typewriter effects in Unity, using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters` is far more performant than manual string concatenation, as it avoids frequent layout rebuilds and memory allocations. Crucially, cinematic dialogue triggers should not always block the main sequence; by not yielding on the typewriter coroutine, we preserve the original pacing and synchronization of animations and sound while still providing a polished visual reveal.
**Action:** Always use `maxVisibleCharacters` for text animation in TMP and carefully consider whether a UX effect should block or run in parallel with sequence timers.
## 2026-03-19 - [Cinematic Typewriter Effect]
**Learning:** Using 'TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters' to reveal text character-by-character provides a smoother, more 'cinematic' feel for dialogue sequences compared to direct text updates. It also prevents layout recalculations that can occur when modifying the text string itself.
**Action:** Apply this 'ShowDialogue' and 'TypeDialogue' pattern for all dialogue-heavy cinematic sequences to ensure consistent pacing and visual polish.
## 2025-03-15 - Initial UX Exploration
**Learning:** This Unity project primarily contains C# scripts for a cinematic sequence. Most UI is handled via TMPro in Cinematic_IntoTheVoid.cs.
**Action:** Focus on improving the dialogue UI or interactions within the cinematic script.
## 2025-03-18 - [Typewriter Effect for Cinematics]
**Learning:** For dialogue-heavy cinematics in Unity, using TextMeshPro's `maxVisibleCharacters` is the most performant and layout-safe way to implement a typewriter effect. It prevents layout shifts and handles rich text tags (like colors or bolding) correctly by revealing the already-calculated characters rather than building the string character by character.
**Action:** Use `maxVisibleCharacters` in a coroutine and always manage coroutine references (`StopCoroutine`) to prevent overlapping text animations when dialogues change quickly.
## 2024-03-20 - [Cinematic Typewriter Effect]
**Learning:** Cinematic dialogue in Unity is more engaging when revealed via a typewriter effect using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters`, as it prevents layout rebuilds while maintaining pacing.
**Action:** Use a dedicated `TypeDialogue` coroutine and `ShowDialogue` helper to manage speaker transitions and text reveal animations.
## 2026-03-21 - [Typewriter Effect in Cinematics]
**Learning:** In cinematic dialogue sequences, revealing text character-by-character (typewriter effect) using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters` provides a more engaging and readable experience than instant text display. It allows players to follow the narrative pace and prevents them from being overwhelmed by large blocks of text appearing at once. This approach also avoids layout rebuilds during the reveal, ensuring a smooth visual experience.
**Action:** Use the `TypeDialogue` coroutine pattern with a standardized character reveal delay (e.g., 0.03s) for all cinematic dialogue in future mission implementations.

## 2025-05-15 - Initial UX Audit
**Learning:** Unity UI (TextMeshPro) dialogue sequences often feel static if text appears instantly. A typewriter effect adds a sense of "living" dialogue and helps users pace their reading.
**Action:** Implement a typewriter effect coroutine for the `Cinematic_IntoTheVoid` script.
