## 2025-05-15 - [Optimizing Typewriter Effects for Cinematic Pacing]
**Learning:** When implementing typewriter effects in Unity, using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters` is far more performant than manual string concatenation, as it avoids frequent layout rebuilds and memory allocations. Crucially, cinematic dialogue triggers should not always block the main sequence; by not yielding on the typewriter coroutine, we preserve the original pacing and synchronization of animations and sound while still providing a polished visual reveal.
**Action:** Always use `maxVisibleCharacters` for text animation in TMP and carefully consider whether a UX effect should block or run in parallel with sequence timers.
## 2026-03-19 - [Cinematic Typewriter Effect]
**Learning:** Using 'TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters' to reveal text character-by-character provides a smoother, more 'cinematic' feel for dialogue sequences compared to direct text updates. It also prevents layout recalculations that can occur when modifying the text string itself.
**Action:** Apply this 'ShowDialogue' and 'TypeDialogue' pattern for all dialogue-heavy cinematic sequences to ensure consistent pacing and visual polish.
## 2025-03-15 - Initial UX Exploration
**Learning:** This Unity project primarily contains C# scripts for a cinematic sequence. Most UI is handled via TMPro in Cinematic_IntoTheVoid.cs.
**Action:** Focus on improving the dialogue UI or interactions within the cinematic script.
## 2025-03-18 - [Typewriter Effect for Cinematics]
**Learning:** For dialogue-heavy cinematics in Unity, using TextMeshPro's `maxVisibleCharacters` is the most performant and layout-safe way to implement a typewriter effect. It prevents layout shifts and handles rich text tags (like colors or bolding) correctly by revealing the already-calculated characters rather than building the string character by character.
**Action:** Use `maxVisibleCharacters` in a coroutine and always manage coroutine references (`StopCoroutine`) to prevent overlapping text animations when dialogues change quickly.
## 2024-03-20 - [Cinematic Typewriter Effect]
**Learning:** Cinematic dialogue in Unity is more engaging when revealed via a typewriter effect using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters`, as it prevents layout rebuilds while maintaining pacing.
**Action:** Use a dedicated `TypeDialogue` coroutine and `ShowDialogue` helper to manage speaker transitions and text reveal animations.
## 2026-03-21 - [Typewriter Effect in Cinematics]
**Learning:** In cinematic dialogue sequences, revealing text character-by-character (typewriter effect) using `TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters` provides a more engaging and readable experience than instant text display. It allows players to follow the narrative pace and prevents them from being overwhelmed by large blocks of text appearing at once. This approach also avoids layout rebuilds during the reveal, ensuring a smooth visual experience.
**Action:** Use the `TypeDialogue` coroutine pattern with a standardized character reveal delay (e.g., 0.03s) for all cinematic dialogue in future mission implementations.

## 2025-05-15 - Initial UX Audit
**Learning:** Unity UI (TextMeshPro) dialogue sequences often feel static if text appears instantly. A typewriter effect adds a sense of "living" dialogue and helps users pace their reading.
**Action:** Implement a typewriter effect coroutine for the `Cinematic_IntoTheVoid` script.
## 2026-03-22 - [Unified Typewriter Effect in Unity TMP]
**Learning:** Consolidating multiple, often conflicting, dialogue implementations into a single 'ShowDialogue' pattern using 'TextMeshProUGUI.maxVisibleCharacters' significantly improves UI stability and performance. Reusing 'WaitForSeconds' objects via a cache (e.g., GetWait helper) is essential for minimizing GC pressure in character-by-character text reveal loops.
**Action:** Always prefer 'maxVisibleCharacters' over manual string concatenation for text reveal animations and implement a 'GetWait' caching pattern for all high-frequency coroutine yields.

## 2026-03-24 - [Natural Pacing and Skip Support for Cinematic Dialogue]
**Learning:** A "one-speed-fits-all" typewriter effect can feel robotic. Adding subtle delays after punctuation (periods, question marks, commas) significantly improves the "readability" and natural feel of dialogue. Furthermore, providing a responsive "skip to end" interaction is critical for accessibility and user agency. This is best implemented by polling for input in `Update()` to set a flag, ensuring the skip is caught even during long punctuation pauses.
**Action:** Implement `punctuationPause` and `commaPause` logic and an asynchronous `skipRequested` flag for all cinematic dialogue systems.
## 2024-05-20 - [Robust Dialogue Skip & Unity Serialization]
**Learning:** For responsive skip mechanics in Unity coroutines that include punctuation pauses, polling input in 'Update' to set a persistent flag is more reliable than per-frame 'Input' checks within the loop. Additionally, when renaming serialized UX settings (like 'typingSpeed'), using '[FormerlySerializedAs]' is critical to prevent data loss in the Unity Inspector.
**Action:** Use a 'skipRequested' flag pattern and 'FormerlySerializedAs' for all Unity UI/UX script refactors.
## 2026-03-23 - [Rhythmic Typewriter and Speaker Color-Coding]
**Learning:** Dialogue-heavy cinematics benefit from punctuation-aware typewriter timing (longer pauses after '.', '?', ',', etc.), which mimics the natural cadence of speech and improves readability. Additionally, color-coding speaker names provides an immediate visual cue for character identification, reducing cognitive load during fast-paced sequences.
**Action:** Implement rhythmic pauses in typewriter effects and use consistent character-specific color palettes for speaker UI to enhance immersion and accessibility.

## 2026-03-24 - [Dialogue Completion Indicator]
**Learning:** In narrative-driven interfaces, users often struggle to know exactly when a typewriter effect has finished, especially if the last sentence is short. Adding a visual "Continue" indicator (like a '▽' symbol) at the end of the reveal provides a clear affordance that the dialogue sequence is ready for the next interaction.
**Action:** Always append a completion symbol or change the UI state once a text reveal animation concludes to improve usability and reduce user uncertainty.
## 2025-05-20 - [Rich Text Aware Typewriter Reveal]
**Learning:** In Unity TextMeshPro, iterating over string length for typewriter reveals can break when rich text tags (like <color> or <b>) are present, as the tag characters are revealed one-by-one. Using 'TMP_Text.ForceMeshUpdate()' followed by iterating over 'TMP_Text.textInfo.characterCount' ensures only rendered characters are revealed, maintaining both accessibility (screen readers) and visual polish.
**Action:** Always use 'textInfo.characterCount' and 'ForceMeshUpdate' for typewriter effects to ensure compatibility with rich text and accurate character-based pacing.

## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Cinematic Skip Pattern]
**Learning:** A "Unified Skip" (skipping both the typewriter reveal and the subsequent wait period with a single input) is best implemented by NOT resetting the 'skipRequested' flag after the typewriter effect ends. Instead, the flag should be consumed and reset only at the end of the final 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' delay in the dialogue block. This ensures that player intent is fully honored across multiple yielded coroutines.
**Action:** In cinematic sequences, manage the 'skipRequested' lifecycle such that it persists through the reveal and is only cleared after the following pause is handled.
## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Cinematic Skip and Text Legibility Outlines]
**Learning:** For a smooth cinematic experience in Unity, implementing a unified skip mechanic (using a 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' coroutine) allows players to bypass both the typewriter reveal and the subsequent pause with a single input, making the dialogue feel more responsive. Additionally, applying black outlines to TextMeshProUGUI components (outlineWidth = 0.2f, outlineColor = Color.black) is a critical accessibility pattern to ensure text legibility against dynamic or visually complex backgrounds.
**Action:** Use 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' for dialogue pauses and always apply text outlines to mission-critical UI elements for better accessibility and polish.

## 2026-03-24 - [Scaling Rhythmic Typewriter and Progression Cues]
**Learning:** Rhythmic punctuation pauses in typewriter effects are most effective when they occur *after* the punctuation character is revealed (checking index `i-1`) and use multipliers (e.g., 15x, 8x) instead of fixed delays. This ensures the cadence remains natural even when base typing speeds vary by character. Additionally, appending a visual completion cue (like '▽') provides essential feedback that a dialogue block is finished and the user can proceed.
**Action:** Always use speed multipliers for rhythmic pauses and include a visual completion character after typewriter reveals to improve readability and interaction clarity.

## 2026-03-25 - [Intelligent Typewriter Rhythm and Color-Coded Cues]
**Learning:** Rhythmic punctuation pauses in typewriter effects are most effective when they handle ellipses and mid-word periods intelligently to maintain natural cadence and readability. Color-coding the dialogue completion cue to match the speaker's theme provides a subtle but consistent visual branding.
**Action:** Implement look-ahead and look-behind logic for punctuation characters in typewriter effects to distinguish between sentence ends, ellipses, and mid-word punctuation. Use character-specific color tags for visual UI cues.
## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Cinematic Skipping and Legibility Outlines]
**Learning:** In dialogue-heavy Unity cinematics, players often find it frustrating when they can skip the text reveal but remain 'locked' in the subsequent pause before the next line. Implementing a unified skip pattern where the 'skipRequested' flag persists through a custom 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' coroutine allows for a much more responsive experience. Additionally, applying black outlines to TextMeshProUGUI components (outlineWidth = 0.2f) is a low-cost, high-impact accessibility win for ensuring legibility against varied or dark backgrounds.
**Action:** Always implement skippable pauses in cinematics to match the typewriter skip, and default to using TMP outlines for all critical dialogue UI.
## 2026-03-25 - [Context-Aware Typewriter Logic and Thematic UI]
**Learning:** Enhancing typewriter effects with context-aware logic—such as look-ahead checks to ignore pauses for mid-word periods (e.g., "Sky.ix") and rhythmic delays for ellipses—significantly improves narrative immersion. Furthermore, applying character-specific color coding to UI elements like the completion character ("▽") provides intuitive thematic cues that reinforce speaker identity without cluttering the interface.
**Action:** Implement look-ahead logic to handle edge-case punctuation and use speaker-themed rich text for UI feedback symbols.
## 2026-03-25 - [Refined Typewriter Rhythm and Character-Coded Cues]
**Learning:** Typewriter effects can feel jerky if mid-word periods (e.g., "Sky.ix") trigger full sentence-end pauses; verifying if the next character is non-whitespace before applying a delay preserves natural cadence. Additionally, color-coding progression cues (like "▽") using speaker-specific rich text tags provides a thematic "finish line" for users that reinforces character identity without cluttering the UI.
**Action:** Use look-ahead logic to distinguish sentence endings from mid-word punctuation and utilize rich-text-tagged symbols for character-specific completion feedback.
## 2026-03-25 - [Interactive Cinematic Sequences and Visual Feedback]
**Learning:** Implementing interactive cinematic sequences by replacing fixed 'GetWait' delays with skippable coroutines ('WaitForSecondsOrSkip') empowers players to control the narrative pace, significantly improving UX. Furthermore, adding subtle scale-based animations (like a 'Pop' effect) to UI elements when content changes (e.g., speaker names) provides essential visual feedback, making the interface feel more responsive and "alive."
**Action:** Always prefer skippable delays for cinematic pauses and use subtle scale animations for UI state transitions to enhance responsiveness.
## 2026-03-25 - [Rhythmic Typewriter Refinement and Thematic Cues]
**Learning:** Standard punctuation-aware typewriter effects often fail on edge cases like mid-word periods (e.g., "Sky.ix") or ellipses ("..."), leading to jarring pauses. By implementing look-ahead logic (checking for whitespace after a period) and neighbor-dot detection for ellipses, the pacing remains natural. Additionally, color-coding visual progression cues (like '▽') using speaker-specific hex colors reinforces character identity and provides a more cohesive "thematic" feel to the UI.
**Action:** Always implement look-ahead/behind checks for punctuation pauses and ensure completion cues are visually integrated with the speaker's established color palette.
## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Cinematic Skipping]
**Learning:** In interactive cinematics, players expect a single input to advance the scene meaningfully. By centralizing the 'skipRequested' flag lifecycle within a dedicated 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' coroutine, we ensure that skipping a typewriter reveal naturally flows into skipping the subsequent pause, creating a more responsive and respectful UX.
**Action:** Implement 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' for all cinematic delays and only reset the skip flag at the end of the pause, not the reveal.
## 2026-03-25 - [Contextual Punctuation and Theme-Linked Cues]
**Learning:** Generic punctuation-based pauses can feel jerky when encountering mid-word periods (e.g., in character names like 'Sky.ix') or ellipses. Implementing contextual checks (e.g., next-character whitespace) prevents unnatural delays. Furthermore, linking the visual progression cue ('▽') to the speaker's specific color theme creates a more cohesive and delightful UX without adding interface clutter.
**Action:** Always implement look-ahead/look-behind checks for punctuation pauses to handle abbreviations and ellipses, and leverage existing theme tokens (like speaker colors) for micro-interactions and visual cues.
## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Skipping for Cinematic Dialogue]
**Learning:** In narrative-heavy games, players often read faster than the typewriter effect reveals text. Implementing a "Unified Skip" pattern—where a single input skips both the typewriter reveal AND the subsequent fixed cinematic pause—significantly improves game flow and player agency. This is achieved by maintaining the `skipRequested` flag across both coroutines and only resetting it after the final delay in a dialogue block.
**Action:** Use a persistent `skipRequested` flag and skippable delay coroutines (`WaitForSecondsOrSkip`) to allow players to bypass both text reveal and cinematic pauses with a single interaction.
## 2026-03-25 - [Granular Typewriter Punctuation Handling]
**Learning:** Standard typewriter punctuation pauses (e.g., 15x delay for periods) can feel "broken" or stuttery when encountering ellipsis (...) or mid-word periods (e.g., "Sky.ix"). Implementing a look-ahead/look-behind check to detect these patterns allows for smoother, more natural-feeling text reveal without sacrificing the rhythmic impact of actual sentence ends.
**Action:** Always implement context-aware punctuation checks in typewriter effects: use reduced multipliers for ellipsis dots and zero extra delay for mid-word abbreviations or technical names.
## 2026-03-25 - [Unified Dialogue Skip UX]
**Learning:** In narrative-heavy Unity cinematics, players appreciate a responsive skipping system that respects their reading speed. Implementing a `WaitForSecondsOrSkip` pattern—where a single input skips both the typewriter reveal and the subsequent cinematic pause—creates a much smoother experience. Key to this is managing the `skipRequested` flag lifecycle such that it only resets *after* the final pause in a dialogue beat.
**Action:** Use `WaitForSecondsOrSkip` for all cinematic pauses and defer `skipRequested` resets until the end of the wait block to support unified skipping.
## 2024-03-28 - [Unified Skip and Visual Feedback for Cinematics]
**Learning:** In dialogue-heavy cinematics, user frustration is often caused by unskippable "cinematic pauses" that occur after the text has finished revealing. By implementing a unified skip flag that isn't reset until *after* the post-dialogue delay, users can skip both the typewriter reveal and the subsequent pause with a single input. Additionally, adding subtle visual feedback like a 'Pop' scale animation on the speaker name when it changes helps anchor the user's attention and makes the UI transition feel more intentional and polished.
**Action:** Use a 'WaitForSecondsOrSkip' pattern for all cinematic delays and always provide a subtle visual cue (e.g., scale pop, color shift) when switching speakers to improve interaction clarity and "juice".
## 2026-03-25 - [Context-Aware Punctuation Pacing]
**Learning:** Standard 15x punctuation delays in typewriter effects can feel broken when applied to mid-word periods (e.g., "Sky.ix") or ellipsis dots, which require shorter, rhythmic pauses. Verifying if a character is part of a cluster (for ellipsis) or followed by a non-whitespace character (for names/technical terms) allows the system to maintain conversational flow without technical interruptions.
**Action:** Implement look-ahead and look-behind checks for periods to distinguish between sentence ends, ellipsis dots, and mid-word abbreviations to ensure fluid dialogue pacing.
## 2026-03-25 - [Context-Aware Punctuation Pauses and Themed Feedback]
**Learning:** Standard punctuation pauses (e.g., 15x delay) can feel disruptive when applied to ellipses (...) or mid-word periods in specialized names (e.g., 'Sky.ix'). Refining these pauses to 5x for ellipsis and 0x for mid-word periods maintains narrative flow. Furthermore, color-coding completion cues (▽) to match speaker themes (using rich text tags) reinforces character identity and provides a polished, cohesive UI experience.
**Action:** Use look-ahead logic to distinguish punctuation context (ellipsis vs. end-of-sentence vs. mid-word) and apply speaker-themed rich text to all interaction cues.
## 2026-03-25 - [Accessibility and Interaction in Cinematics]
**Learning:** When adding skippable waits (`WaitForSecondsOrSkip`) to Unity cinematics, the `skipRequested` flag should be managed carefully to avoid race conditions. Resetting it only at the *start* of a new dialogue block (rather than after each skip) allows a single user input to skip both the typing animation and the following cinematic pause. For accessibility, always ensure high contrast by adding black outlines to TMP text elements in scenes with dynamic or unpredictable backgrounds.
**Action:** Use a centralized skip flag lifecycle and mandatory TMP outlines (0.2 width) for improved cinematic accessibility and control.
