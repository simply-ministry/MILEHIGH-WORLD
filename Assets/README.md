# MILEHIGH.WORLD - Generated Unity Package

## Scene: Deep within the anti-reality of ŤĤÊ VØĪĐ, the very concept of existence is under assault. Delilah, an agent of entropy, has located and harnessed a 'Memory Stream'—a torrent of glitching data containing the metaphysical essence of Sky.ix's recently reunited husband and child. She intends to weaponize this stream, funneling its corrupted energy into a finality engine that will not just kill them, but permanently erase their existence from every timeline and memory. Sky.ix, whose cybernetics offer a fragile anchor in this digital abyss, must race against the unraveling of reality itself, supported by her ally Kai, to sever Delilah's connection before her family becomes nothing more than a corrupted file in the memory of the universe.

This package contains all the necessary scripts to set up the generated cinematic/gameplay scene in a Unity project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Project Setup
- Open your Unity project (or create a new one).
- Create the following folder structure inside your `Assets` directory:
  - `Assets/Scripts/Core`
  - `Assets/Scripts/Characters`
  - `Assets/Scripts/Cinematics`
  - `Assets/Scripts/Data`
  - `Assets/Scripts/Editor` (This is important!)
  - `Assets/Scripts/Physics`
  - `Assets/Scripts/SceneManagement`

### 2. Copy Scripts
- Copy the contents of each C# script from this package into a new C# file in your Unity project.
- **IMPORTANT:** Place each script in the correct folder with the exact filename. For example, `AsyncSceneLoader.cs` goes into `Assets/Scripts/SceneManagement`.
- **CRITICAL:** Any script with "Editor" in its name (like `MultiSceneSetup.cs`) or purpose MUST be placed in the `Assets/Scripts/Editor` folder.

### 3. Scene Setup
