// --- UNITY SCENE SETUP --- //
//
// 1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene and name it "SceneController".
//
// 2. Attach this script (`Cinematic_IntoTheVoid.cs`)
//    to the "SceneController" GameObject.
//
// 3. Create or place the character prefabs/GameObjects for "Sky.ix", "Kai", and "Delilah" into the scene.
//
// 4. Ensure each character GameObject has the following components attached:
//    - An Animator component with a configured Animation Controller.
//    - An AudioSource component to be used for their voice lines.
//    - Their respective ability script (e.g., Sky.ix needs `Ability_Skyix.cs`, Kai needs `Ability_Kai.cs`, etc.)
//
// 5. Create the UI for the dialogue system:
//    - Right-click in the Hierarchy -> UI -> Canvas.
//    - Inside the Canvas, create a UI -> Panel. Rename it "DialogueBox". This will be the background.
//    - Inside the "DialogueBox", create two UI -> Text - TextMeshPro objects.
//    - Name the first one "SpeakerNameText" and position it where the speaker's name should appear.
//    - Name the second one "DialogueText" and position it for the main dialogue content.
//    - Create a third TMP object named "SkipHint", set its text to "[Space] Skip", and place it in a corner.
//    - Initially, set the "DialogueBox" GameObject to be inactive.
//
// 6. Select the "SceneController" GameObject. In the Inspector, drag and drop the corresponding scene objects
//    into the public fields of this script.
//
// 7. Ensure your project has TextMeshPro imported.
// 2. Attach this script (Cinematic_IntoTheVoid.cs) to it.
// 3. Configure character prefabs (Sky.ix, Kai, Delilah) with Animators and AudioSources.
// 4. Setup UI: Canvas -> DialogueBox (Panel) -> SpeakerNameText (TMP), DialogueText (TMP), SkipHint (TMP).
// 5. Drag and drop references into the Inspector.
