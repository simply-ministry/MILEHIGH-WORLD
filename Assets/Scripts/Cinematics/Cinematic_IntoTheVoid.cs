// --- UNITY SCENE SETUP --- //
//
// 1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene and name it "SceneController".
//
// 2. Attach this script (`Cinematic_IntoTheVoid.cs`)
//    to the "SceneController" GameObject.
//
// 3. Create or place the character prefabs/GameObjects for "Sky.ix", "Kai", and "Delilah" into the scene.
//
// 4. Ensure each character GameObject has the following components attached:
//    - An Animator component with a configured Animation Controller.
//    - An AudioSource component to be used for their voice lines.
//    - Their respective ability script (e.g., Sky.ix needs `Ability_Skyix.cs`, Kai needs `Ability_Kai.cs`, etc.)
//
// 5. Create the UI for the dialogue system:
//    - Right-click in the Hierarchy -> UI -> Canvas.
//    - Inside the Canvas, create a UI -> Panel. Rename it "DialogueBox". This will be the background.
//    - Inside the "DialogueBox", create two UI -> Text - TextMeshPro objects.
//    - Name the first one "SpeakerNameText" and position it where the speaker's name should appear.
//    - Name the second one "DialogueText" and position for the main dialogue content.
//    - Initially, set the "DialogueBox" GameObject to be inactive (uncheck the box in the Inspector).
//
// 6. Select the "SceneController" GameObject. In the Inspector, drag and drop the corresponding scene objects
//    into the public fields of this script:
//    - Drag the "Sky.ix" GameObject into the `Skyix_Character` field.
//    - Drag the AudioSource from "Sky.ix" into the `Skyix_VoiceSource` field.
//    - Drag the "Kai" GameObject into the `Kai_Character` field.
//    - Drag the AudioSource from "Kai" into the `Kai_VoiceSource` field.
//    - Drag the "Delilah" GameObject into the `Delilah_Character` field.
//    - Drag the AudioSource from "Delilah" into the `Delilah_VoiceSource` field.
//    - Drag the "DialogueBox" panel into the `Dialogue Box` field.
//    - Drag the "SpeakerNameText" TMP object into the `Speaker Name Text` field.
//    - Drag the "DialogueText" TMP object into the `Dialogue Text` field.
//
// 7. Ensure your project has TextMeshPro imported (Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources).

/// <summary>
/// This script controls the cinematic sequence for the mission: "Deep within the anti-reality of ŤĤÊ VØĪĐ, the very concept of existence is under assault. Delilah, an agent of entropy, has located and harnessed a 'Memory Stream'—a torrent of glitching data containing the metaphysical essence of Sky.ix's recently reunited husband and child. She intends to weaponize this stream, funneling its corrupted energy into a finality engine that will not just kill them, but permanently erase their existence from every timeline and memory. Sky.ix, whose cybernetics offer a fragile anchor in this digital abyss, must race against the unraveling of reality itself, supported by her ally Kai, to sever Delilah's connection before her family becomes nothing more than a corrupted file in the memory of the universe."
