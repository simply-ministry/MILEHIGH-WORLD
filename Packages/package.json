Delilah, an agent of entropy, has located and harnessed a 'Memory Stream'—a torrent of glitching data containing the metaphysical essence of Sky.ix's recently reunited husband and child. She intends to weaponize this stream, funneling its corrupted energy into a finality engine that will not just kill them, but permanently erase their existence from every timeline and memory. Sky.ix, whose cybernetics offer a fragile anchor in this digital abyss, must race against the unraveling of reality itself, supported by her ally Kai, to sever Delilah's connection before her family becomes nothing more than a corrupted file in the memory of the universe.",
