## 2024-05-24 - Unity GameObject.Find Performance Bottleneck
**Learning:** In Unity 3D scripts like `SceneDirector.cs` within this project, methods frequently call `GameObject.Find()` to search for characters or interactive objects by name during scene setups. This forces Unity to traverse the entire scene hierarchy repeatedly (O(N) operation), which can cause noticeable load times or frame drops if called continuously or on large scenes.
**Action:** Replace direct `GameObject.Find()` calls with a `Dictionary<string, GameObject>` cache when objects are fetched by name multiple times or instantiated dynamically. Check `cachedObj != null` to handle Unity's custom object destruction logic safely before returning a cached reference.

## 2024-03-16 - Unity Coroutine Yield Instruction Caching
**Learning:** Found that using inline `new WaitForSeconds(time)` repeatedly inside Unity coroutines (especially in heavily choreographed cinematic sequences) generates unnecessary Garbage Collection allocations every time the coroutine hits that yield instruction, which can lead to GC spikes and frame stuttering.
**Action:** Always cache frequently used yield instructions like `WaitForSeconds` in a shared static dictionary or similar caching mechanism, so that existing yield objects are reused and no extra garbage is created per sequence execution.

## 2024-05-15 - Shader 'pow()' optimization
**Learning:** Using `pow(x, c)` for small constant integer exponents in pixel-evaluated fragment shaders can be highly unoptimized depending on the graphics API.
**Action:** Always rewrite integer-based exponentiation as explicit variable multiplications. For example, use `x * x * x` instead of `pow(x, 3.0)` to save ALU cycles and improve GPU fragment processing times.

## 2025-03-27 - Dead Code Elimination in Surface Shaders
**Learning:** Identified a performance bottleneck in `HyperPBRCharacter_4D.shader` where a complex Subsurface Scattering (SSS) block was being calculated but immediately overwritten by a final Albedo assignment. This caused wasted GPU fragment shader cycles and redundant texture samples per pixel.
**Action:** Always audit surface shader functions for value overwrites. Removing dead logic blocks that do not contribute to the final output is a high-impact optimization. When optimizing, preserve `Properties` to maintain material backward compatibility.
