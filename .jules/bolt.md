## 2024-05-24 - Expensive Scene Traversal in Initialization Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` causes O(N) scene hierarchy traversals, which becomes a severe bottleneck when called repeatedly inside initialization loops (e.g., `SceneDirector.SetupScene` iterating over character profiles and interactive objects).
**Action:** Always use a dictionary cache (`Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references during scene initialization sequences, ensuring to check `obj != null` on retrieval to handle natively destroyed objects correctly.
## 2024-05-24 - Expensive GameObject.Find in Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` is an O(N) operation traversing the scene hierarchy and is especially expensive when called repeatedly inside loops or initialization sequences like `SceneDirector.SetupScene`.
**Action:** Always use dictionary caches (e.g., `Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references to avoid repeated scene traversals.
