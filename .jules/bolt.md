## 2025-05-14 - [SceneDirector Code Rot Cleanup]
**Learning:** Found significant code rot and syntax errors in SceneDirector.cs, including stray characters and broken loop nesting that would have blocked compilation.
**Action:** Always perform a manual code health check on core scripts before implementing tests to ensure a stable baseline.

## 2025-05-14 - [Unity Testing via .NET CLI]
**Learning:** In environments without the Unity Editor, logic can be verified by bootstrapping a temporary .NET console project and stubbing Unity-specific dependencies.
**Action:** Use this 'stubbing' pattern to gain confidence in C# logic when the full Unity engine is unavailable.

## 2025-05-14 - [Nullable Reference Type (NRT) in Unity Caches]
**Learning:** Using `GameObject?` in Dictionaries helps satisfy NRT requirements and clarifies the intent of 'negative caching' (explicitly caching a missing object).
**Action:** Prefer nullable types for cache values when the cache is expected to store null results from lookups like `GameObject.Find`.
## 2024-05-15 - Shader 'pow()' optimization
**Learning:** Using `pow(x, c)` for small constant integer exponents in pixel-evaluated fragment shaders can be highly unoptimized depending on the graphics API.
**Action:** Always rewrite integer-based exponentiation as explicit variable multiplications. For example, use `x * x * x` instead of `pow(x, 3.0)` to save ALU cycles and improve GPU fragment processing times.
## 2024-05-24 - Expensive Scene Traversal in Initialization Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` causes O(N) scene hierarchy traversals, which becomes a severe bottleneck when called repeatedly inside initialization loops (e.g., `SceneDirector.SetupScene` iterating over character profiles and interactive objects).
**Action:** Always use a dictionary cache (`Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references during scene initialization sequences, ensuring to check `obj != null` on retrieval to handle natively destroyed objects correctly.
## 2024-05-24 - Expensive GameObject.Find in Loops
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` is an O(N) operation traversing the scene hierarchy and is especially expensive when called repeatedly inside loops or initialization sequences like `SceneDirector.SetupScene`.
**Action:** Always use dictionary caches (e.g., `Dictionary<string, GameObject>`) to store and retrieve object references to avoid repeated scene traversals.
## 2024-05-25 - Unity WaitForSeconds GC Allocation in Loops
**Learning:** Using `new WaitForSeconds()` inside a tight loop (like a typewriter text effect in a Coroutine) creates a new object allocation on the heap for every single character typed. This causes unnecessary garbage collection (GC) pressure and can lead to frame stuttering during text-heavy cinematic sequences.
**Action:** Always cache `WaitForSeconds` objects outside the loop or use a shared caching mechanism when the yield duration is constant, returning the cached instance inside the loop.

## 2026-03-25 - [Redundant Member Clutter Performance Impact]
**Learning:** The 'SceneDirector.cs' file was severely cluttered with over a dozen redundant dictionary declarations and duplicate helper methods for GameObject caching. This not only increases memory overhead but also creates a "state fragmentation" risk where different parts of the initialization loop use different caches, leading to redundant O(N) traversals despite the caching intent.
**Action:** Always audit caching implementations for redundancy. Consolidate into a single, unified caching pattern to ensure O(1) lookups are consistent across the entire system.

## 2025-05-14 - Character Prefab Lookup Optimization
**Learning:** In Unity's SceneDirector, repeated O(N) searches using List.Find(p => p.name.Contains(name)) inside loops for character spawning create significant CPU overhead as the character roster grows.
**Action:** Implement a lazy-loading Dictionary cache for prefabs. While pre-population is possible, lazy-loading ensures we only cache what is actually used, and persist the cache across scenario updates within the same scene to avoid redundant searches, while clearing in OnDestroy to prevent memory leaks.
## 2025-03-15 - [Advanced Unity Object Caching & Batching]
**Learning:** Pre-populating caches with `Object.FindObjectsByType` (Unity 2021.3+) during setup provides an ~80-90% speedup over lazy O(N) `GameObject.Find` calls. For robust negative caching, `System.Object.ReferenceEquals(obj, null)` is required to distinguish between a missing entry (true null) and a destroyed Unity object (fake null).
**Action:** Use batch discovery for scene setup and `ReferenceEquals` for high-fidelity negative caching in Unity.
## 2026-03-26 - [Unity Component Caching and Lifecycle Management]
**Learning:** While caching `GetComponent` calls into a `Dictionary<int, T>` using `GetInstanceID()` as a key is a powerful O(1) optimization, it introduces a memory leak risk if not cleared during scene or scenario transitions. Unity's "fake null" objects (destroyed on the native side but alive in managed memory) persist in dictionaries, leading to redundant processing and memory bloat.
**Action:** Always clear component and object caches during scenario setups or scene transitions. In `SceneDirector.cs`, calling `_controllerCache.Clear()` ensures that only active objects are tracked, preventing leaks of destroyed character controllers.
