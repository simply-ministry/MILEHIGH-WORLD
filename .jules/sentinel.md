## 2025-05-14 - Code Rot as a Security Risk in Core Data Management
**Vulnerability:** Extreme code rot (redundant member declarations, syntax errors, and duplicate logic) in `CampaignManager.cs` and `CharacterData.cs` created a scenario where security validation could be accidentally bypassed. For example, `CampaignManager.cs` had overlapping `if` blocks that assigned deserialized data to global state even if validation failed on a different instance of the same data.
**Learning:** Code rot isn't just a maintainability issue; it's a security vulnerability. Contradictory or redundant logic paths make it difficult to verify that security controls (like `IsValid()` checks) are consistently and correctly applied.
**Prevention:** Consolidate data structures and logic into a single, clean "source of truth." Ensure that validation logic is performed on the exact object being assigned to the global state immediately after deserialization.

## 2025-05-14 - Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Unsanitized Trait Strings
**Vulnerability:** While `HorizonGameData.cs` limited the number of traits per character, it did not limit the length of individual trait strings. A malicious JSON could contain a few traits each with millions of characters, leading to memory exhaustion.
**Learning:** Defense-in-depth requires validating both the quantity and the size of individual elements in collections sourced from external data.
**Prevention:** Implement length constraints for every string field in a serializable data model, especially within lists.

## 2024-05-24 - IDOR in Data-Driven Scene Construction
**Vulnerability:** `GameObject.Find` was used directly on unsanitized external strings from JSON, granting uncontrolled access to any scene hierarchy object.
**Learning:** External data targeting interactive objects can specify core singletons (like `CampaignManager` or `SceneDirector`), allowing attackers to manipulate or destroy critical game components. Broad heuristics like `.Contains("Manager")` break legitimate objects.
**Prevention:** Use exact string matching or specific tagging to block unauthorized access to core architectural singletons when performing dynamic object lookups.

## 2026-04-14 - Denial of Service (DoS) mitigation for GameObject.Find
**Vulnerability:** Untrusted input from JSON was used in `GameObject.Find` in `SceneDirector.cs`. Maliciously long strings or path-traversal-like patterns (e.g., using `/`) could lead to expensive scene traversals or unexpected object access.
**Learning:** `GameObject.Find` is an O(N) operation that can be abused. While caching helps, the initial lookup using unsanitized strings is a risk.
**Prevention:** Implement strict string length limits (e.g., 128 chars) and character whitelists (alphanumeric, underscores, spaces, etc.) for any string passed to `GameObject.Find` or used as a key in object caches derived from external data.

## 2025-05-14 - [Information Disclosure in Unity Logs]
**Vulnerability:** Absolute file paths being logged during data loading.
**Learning:** Hardcoded paths or `Application.dataPath` in logs can reveal developer filesystem structure.
**Prevention:** Only log filenames or relative identifiers in production-facing logs.

## 2026-05-12 - [Resource Exhaustion via Untrusted JSON Data]
**Vulnerability:** Deserialized campaign data (`HorizonGameData.cs`) lacked uniform length and count constraints, making the application vulnerable to resource exhaustion (DoS) attacks if a malicious JSON with extremely large strings or lists was loaded. Additionally, severe code rot (redundant class definitions) masked these vulnerabilities and impeded security audits.
**Learning:** Code rot and structural duplication not only degrade maintainability but also provide vectors for bypassing security controls or complicating audits. Centralized, hardened `IsValid()` methods are essential for defense-in-depth when dealing with untrusted external data.
**Prevention:** Consolidate data structures to ensure a single source of truth and implement strict validation (length, range, count) for all fields in serializable models.
